# typing-speed-test
<br>
This project is a simple typing speed test application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application fetches random quotes and challenges users to type them as accurately and quickly as possible. It tracks typing accuracy in real-time, displays correct and incorrect characters in different colors, and calculates the elapsed time
